What a year !
In a few hours, 2005 will be part of the past.
This year was extremelly intense for me. Back in March, I joined a new company where I was the only employee in France.
There were very long hours ... and we finished the year with a major order in France :-)
2005 was also a year full of doubts, uncertainty but also promises on a more personal side.

Bottom line, I do not really know how 2005 is finishing ...
For sure, 2006 will be a decisive year !
