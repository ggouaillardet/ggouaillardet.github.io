I was used to getting news from the HPC world from the front page of a well known web site.
Unfortunatly, there is no RSS feed, which would have been very convenient.
Anyway, I found the front page pretty well structured and easy to parse, so I wrote a quick and dirty
php script that parses the front page and generate a feed from the <i>Today's Breaking News</i> section.
So far I am pretty happy with the result :-)
The feed used to be accessible at http://gillesgouaillardet.com/hpc.feed.php
