What would I do if I was *that* rich and more ?<!--break-->
I guess everyone already heard about Anousheh Ansari. She is famous for being the first private female space explorator and for being American and born in Iran.
She is <a href="http://spaceblog.xprize.org">updating her blog</a> directly from the ISS, somewhere in space (!).
This makes me think that if I could afford it, I would definetly buy a ticket to space !
Here are my two best quotes from her blog :

<code>Earth is magnificent and peaceful from up here. You donâ€™t see any of those awful things you hear on the news, from up here.</code>

<code>How I wished everyone could experience this feeling in their heart, specially those who are at the head of the governments in the world. may be this experience would give them a new perspective and help bring peace to the world.</code>
