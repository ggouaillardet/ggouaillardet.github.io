I read this morning that Saddam Hussein was executed earlier today.<!--break-->
Just like most European people, i am strongly against the death penalty, and consequently,
i strongly disapprove what happened this morning. The video which is available everywhere on
the web shows an old man, going to be hanged with dignity.
Is this the last image the world should remember of him ?
I do not think so !

Was hanging a dictator at the beginning of the muslim most hooly day a good thing ?
Should Iraqi justice "prevent" Saddam from being judged for what he did to the Kurds ?
Should the world keep ignoring the help Saddam did receive from western countries
( including mine ) ?

No, no and no.
The civilized world should not use barbary against barbary.

Saddam was a brutal dictator, who killed many people, who did not hesitate to murder his
own people. Most of his life, he was a criminal, not a victim.

So why make him ultimately a victim of death penalty ?
