Yesterday, <a href="http://www.sun.com">Sun Microsystems</a> announced they bought <a href="http://www.clusterfs.com">Cluster File Systems</a><!--break-->
This also means they bought the <a href="http://www.lustre.org">Lustre filesystem</a>.
Lustre already supports Solaris ZFS filesystem as a backend instead of modified ext3 ( ldiskfs ). It will be interesting to see how things move forward : is Linux gonna remain the preferred platform for Lustre servers ( MDS and OSS ) or is this gonna move to (open)Solaris and ZFS only ( and on which hardware ). Another key issue will be the support Sun will be willing to provide to non Sun customers.
For the full details, see the <a href="http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/pr/2007-09/sunflash.20070912.2.xml">press release</a>
