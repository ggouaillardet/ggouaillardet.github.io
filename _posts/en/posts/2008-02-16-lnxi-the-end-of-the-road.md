I have been shocked to read Linux Networx died this week.

I spent a relatively short but very intense part of my life working for Linux Networx and growing their business in France and Europe. I was very happy and lucky to work for a company 100% focused on HPC, with skilled, enthusiastic and passionated people.
The SGI <a href="http://www.hpcwire.com/hpc/2133956.html">press release</a> is pretty unclear on what is the next step for both LNXI employees and customers ...
