After having decided to create my blog, I thought it would be nice to have my own domain name.
I checked some offers on the web and I found <a href="www.amen.fr">amen</a> has a good one.
For only 1 euro a month ( plus vat ... ) I got the domain name <a href="http://gillesgouaillardet.com">gillesgouaillardet.com</a>, and 2 mbytes to host my static pages.

Today, it only loads the real frame from <a href="http://gilles.gouaillardet.free.fr/blog">http://gilles.gouaillardet.free.fr/blog</a> where the site is actually hosted.
The price is really good, but the real impressive thing is I could do that on Sunday evening around 7pm.
Less than one hour later, everything was up and running ( domain name registration, DNS entries, static pages ... ).
So far, this is only what they claim ... and I am really glad they did it !
Unfortunatly the web interface is only in French :-( but if you can understand, I can only recommend you consider using them in order to register your domain name.
