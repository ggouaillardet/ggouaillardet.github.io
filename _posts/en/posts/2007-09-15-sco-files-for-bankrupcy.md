SCO files for bankrupcy ( chapter 11 )<!--break-->
SCO and its CEO Darl McBride will remain famous for having claimed back in September 2003 :
<i>We counted over a million lines of code that we allege are infringed in the Linux kernel today</i>
After a very long trial, their case was basically dismissed ... and now they have no money left !
This is an insane situation ... IBM, Novell and others gave away millions to their lawyers, because they could simply not ask SCO "show us which lines are infringed in the Linux kernel"

Anyway, I cannot resist quoting Linus Torvalds :
<i>"If Darl McBride was in charge, he'd probably make marriage unconstitutional too, since clearly it de-emphasizes the commercial nature of normal human interaction, and probably is a major impediment to the commercial growth of prostitution."</i>
