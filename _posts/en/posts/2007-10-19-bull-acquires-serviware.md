When publishing its Q3/2007 revenues, <a href="http://www.bull.com">Bull</a> officially announced it acquired <a href="http://www.serviware.com">ServiWare</a>.<!--break--> 
Buying the most recognized integrator on the French HPC market, is inline with Bull's commitment to become a key player in this dynamic market. While ServiWare will remain largely independant, it will benefit from Bull's huge OEM catalog ( which includes <a href="http://www.ibm.com">IBM</a>, <a href="http://www.nec.com">NEC</a>, <a href="http://www.supermicro.com">Supermicro</a> and many others ) and will be able to target even more important deals. Bull will benefit from ServiWare's expertise and extensive customer list ( which includes the 'who is who' in HPC in France ).
