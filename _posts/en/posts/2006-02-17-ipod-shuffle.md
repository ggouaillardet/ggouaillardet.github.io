It was a while I wanted to get a mp3 player ...
and then I decided to buy an <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodshuffle/">Apple iPod shuffle</a> 512MB
Here are my comments :<!--break-->
<u>Pros :</u>
- the sound is really excellent, this is still hard to believe for me
- no external battery is required, just load it when connected to an USB port
- no need to reload often
- shuffle is an option only :-) ( I was mislead by the description on the web site ... it is possible to choose between shuffle mode
and normal mode )
<u>Cons :</u>
- all mp3 players I know play a small blank between each tracks, which is pretty annoying when listening a Pink Floyd album ... iPod is unfortunatly not an exception :-(
- IMHO iTunes is not that user friendly ... i could not figure out how to change the order of the songs within one album ( e.g. directory )
- when pressing the 'next track' button several times, results are pretty random ... looks like some actions are discarded

<u>Conclusion</u>
iPod shuffle is really an excellent product which does what is supposed to do : play music with a great sound quality !
I found some minor things that could be improved ... nethertheless I am very happy with my iPod shuffle and I will recommend it to
anyone looking for a simple mp3 player
