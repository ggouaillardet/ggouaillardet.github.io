Yesterday, Apple released <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/">iPod touch</a><!--break-->
and this is likely to be the next tech toy i will buy !
i was relatively impressed by Apple's <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a> but i never considered buying one since i do not believe in all-in-one appliances. Moreover iPhone is not yet available in France ( thought several hackers claimed they were able to unlock it )
This new iPod has the multi-touch interface that was introduced by iPhone, it is of course an iPod able to play music, videos and display photos, but it is also a web browser via its embedded wifi !
iPod touch will ship by the end of september ... and will be slightly cheaper in US, which is ok since i might be in Reno on November :-)
