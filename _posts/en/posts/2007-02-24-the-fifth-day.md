(Too) long after the US, the fifth season of <a href="http://www.fox.com/24">24</a> finally ended in France !<!--break-->
As usual, this was a great, exciting and thrilling one. As far as i am concerned, the
previous one was the best. This one was of course very good, but there are too many things
in the scenario that was incoherent.
The first three seasons were self sufficient, and just like the previous one, the fifht season
is an "introduction" to the sixth season ( now on Fox, in the US )
I believe i will not wait for it to be on TV, but just buy the DVDs in the US as soon as
they are released ...
I will also try not to read the full story which is periodically updated on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_(TV_series)">wikipedia</a>, and this is gonna be hard for sure ;-)
