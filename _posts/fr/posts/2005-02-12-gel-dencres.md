This is the name of a calligraphy exhibition by Jean-Louis Genji Trebosc and Ayuko Miyakawa.

I am always surprised I can enjoy these Japanese calligraphys I do not understand.
Being unable to understand does not necesseraly mean being unable to enjoy and appreciate.
I really love the ones made by Ayuko. I do believe she is a fully talented artist.
The exhibition takes place in a nice house, and I invite you to go there and ... enjoy
